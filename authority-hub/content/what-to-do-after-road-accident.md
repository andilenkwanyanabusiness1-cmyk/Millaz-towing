Road accidents are traumatic experiences that can leave even experienced drivers feeling overwhelmed. Knowing the correct steps to take immediately after an accident can protect your safety, legal rights, and insurance claims. Here's your comprehensive guide for handling accidents on KZN roads.

## Immediate Safety First

The moments after an accident are critical. If possible, move vehicles to the side of the road to prevent further collisions, especially on busy routes like the N3 or M13. Turn on hazard lights immediately and set up warning triangles at least 45 meters behind your vehicle. Check yourself and passengers for injuries – if anyone is hurt, call emergency services (10177 or 112 from mobile) without delay.

## Secure the Scene

On highways around Pinetown and Hillcrest, accidents can create dangerous situations for other motorists. If your vehicle cannot be moved safely, remain inside with seatbelts fastened until help arrives. Never stand in the road or attempt repairs in traffic lanes. Contact traffic authorities to report the accident and request assistance. Use the Spotter App for instant response team dispatch and GPS-precise location sharing.

## Document Everything

Once safe, gather critical information. Exchange details with other drivers including names, contact numbers, license plate numbers, driver's license numbers, and insurance information. Take photographs of all vehicles from multiple angles, capturing damage, license plates, and the surrounding scene. Note road conditions, weather, time, and exact location. If there are witnesses, collect their contact details.

## Contact Your Insurance

Report the accident to your insurance company within 24 hours. Provide factual information without admitting fault or speculating about causes. Your insurer will guide you through their claims process and may recommend approved towing services or repair facilities.

## Arrange Safe Vehicle Removal

If your vehicle isn't drivable, you'll need professional towing. Choose a reputable service that won't further damage your vehicle. For accidents in the Westville, Kloof, and surrounding areas, having a reliable towing company's contact information readily available ensures quick, professional assistance during stressful moments.

## Follow-Up Steps

Visit a doctor even if you feel fine – some injuries manifest hours or days later. Keep all medical records and repair estimates. File a police report at your nearest station within 24 hours if required by your insurance. Maintain a file with all accident-related documents.
Remember: Stay calm, prioritize safety, and take systematic steps. Being prepared makes a difficult situation more manageable.
