                    <p><strong>Managing Risks on South Africa's Busiest Highway</strong></p>
                    <p>The N3 corridor is the economic heartbeat of South Africa, but for a stranded motorist, it can
                        quickly become a high-risk environment. With a heavy concentration of logistics trucks and
                        high-speed passenger vehicles, a breakdown on the N3 requires a specific set of safety
                        protocols. This guide outlines the professional steps to take if your vehicle fails between
                        Durban and Pietermaritzburg.</p>

                    <h2>The Immediate 60 Seconds: Positioning</h2>
                    <p>If you feel your vehicle losing power or hear a mechanical failure, do not wait for it to stop
                        completely. Use your remaining momentum to move as far onto the left shoulder as possible. If
                        there is a barrier, try to position your vehicle so that there is space for you to exit through
                        the passenger door, away from live traffic.</p>

                    <h2>Visibility is Survival</h2>
                    <p>Turn on your hazard lights immediately. On the N3, because of the high speeds, your vehicle needs
                        to be visible from at least 200 meters away. Do not attempt to stand behind your vehicle to wave
                        traffic down – this is fatal. Instead, if it's safe to exit, place your warning triangle at
                        least 45 to 50 meters behind your car. If you are on a curve or hill, place it even further back
                        before the incline begins.</p>

                    <div class="article-callout">
                        <p><strong>Highway Safety Fact:</strong> Most highway fatalities involving stationary vehicles
                            occur because the driver or passengers were standing outside the vehicle in the "crush zone"
                            directly behind the car.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>To Stay or To Exit?</h2>
                    <p>This is the most critical decision. If you have been able to pull well off the road and there is
                        a safe area behind a crash barrier, exit the vehicle through the passenger side and stand as far
                        back from the road as possible. However, if you are stuck in a narrow shoulder or on a bridge
                        with no pedestrian space, it is often safer to remain in the vehicle with your seatbelt
                        fastened. Modern cars are designed to absorb rear-end impacts; the human body is not.</p>

                    <h2>Professional Recovery: The N3 Protocol</h2>
                    <p>The N3 is strictly monitored by the N3 Toll Concession (N3TC) and routine patrols. Avoid
                        accepting help from unverified towers who may be "patrolling" for breakdowns. Instead, contact a
                        verified, insurance-approved recovery service like Millaz Towing. Provide your exact location –
                        look for the blue kilometer markers on the center median or shoulder (e.g., N3 Section 2, KM
                        14.5).</p>

                    <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
                    <p>Unfortunately, breakdowns can attract opportunistic crime. Keep your doors locked and windows up.
                        If someone approaches you and you feel unsafe, do not open the door. Indicate through the window
                        that help is on the way. If you have the Spotter App, use the emergency alert feature to notify
                        our team and nearby verified users of your status.</p>

                    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
                    <p>A breakdown on the N3 is an emergency, not just a mechanical inconvenience. By prioritizing
                        visibility, making smart decisions about whether to stay in the vehicle, and using verified
                        recovery services, you can navigate this high-stress situation safely.</p>
